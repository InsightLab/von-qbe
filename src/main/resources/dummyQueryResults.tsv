http://data.nobelprize.org/resource/laureateaward/855	Developed implementation theory, a theory for achieving particular social or economic goals. An important problem is that a mechanism typically admits multiple equilibria. Even if the best outcome is possible to achieve other inferior solutions may exist. Maskin was first to develop conditions under which all equilibria are optimal.	for having laid the foundations of mechanism design theory

http://datanobelprize.org/resource/laureateaward/700	Had a direct influence on the development of the Black-Scholes formula and generalized it in important ways. By devising another way of deriving the formula, he applied it to other financial instruments, such as mortgages and student loans. The work generated new financial instruments and has facilitated more effective risk management in society.
